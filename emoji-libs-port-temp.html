Of all the projects in my portfolio I think this did the most to increase my understanding of the big picture, all the roles within tech, and how design can best work within them. This portfolio piece reviews both elements of the websites design as well as lessons learned as part of creating content and coding the site.

<div class="thinkBigDiv">
  <p class="thinkBigP">
  When I first began learning about HTML I would get this picture in my mind of Tupperware. I saw the &#34;divs&#34; as the containers of the content (photos, text, etc.), the space around the containers is the margin, and the space around the food/content inside these containers is the padding. I also like the metaphor of HTML as a skeleton that you attach content too, so essentially HTML is a skeleton made of Tupperware.

    My front-end development teacher, Avand, had this bad habit of saying: &#34;that&#39;s easy.&#34; And like that annoying Staples &#34;easy button&#34; him saying it didn&#39;t actually make it so. For my final project I was so focused on making it work I left making it look good until the end. Then Avand said: &#34;you can&#39;t save CSS to the end. CSS is hard!&#34; This for me was a huge victory as I had finally gotten Avand to admit that something was hard. But, all this to say, that <b>nothing in code can ever be taken for granted as &#34;easy.&#34;</b> Sometimes even the most basic things can trip you up, causing you to loose huge chunks of time.

I asked my pair what was the difference between Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I will paraphrase his answer in the style of the SAT: Ruby is to Rails as JavaScript is to jQuery. I had no experience with Ruby, but understood him completely. I know I have just cracked the surface, but any code learning going forward should be much easier for me given my new paradigm.

<div class="swot">

  <div class="topSwot">
    <div class="strengthWeak swotRec">
      <p class="swotTitle">Responsive web</p>
      <p>- Bootstrap is helpful with nav, footer, and scroll tables but it requires a lot of work on visuals.</p>
      <p>- <b>Bootstrap&#39;s grid can help</b> with layout, but <b>you often need to insert media queries to make things work.</b> </p>
      <p>- Using percentages and global margins will help to make responsive easier.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="strengthWeak  swotRec">
      <p class="swotTitle">Break things</p>
      <p>- <b>People often do not want to change their code for fear of breaking it</b>, especially when JavaScript brings your whole page to a screeching halt.</p>
      <p>- <b>But the only way to learn is to change things</b>, break things, and then learn to fix them. (Making commits on GitHub so you can “undo” is a great practice too).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="topSwot">
  <div class="strengthWeak swotRec">
    <p class="swotTitle">Code is Creative</p>
    <p>- Many people think that code is just about being a “monkey,” rote implementation of someone else’s creativity.</p>
    <p>- For this project I was in a unique position: wrote content, designed, and coded. And <b>I found that code was very creative and even inspired better design.</b> </p>
  </div>

  <div class="strengthWeak swotRec">
    <p class="swotTitle">MVP is good</p>
    <p>- <b>Focus on completing a MVP first,</b> get it done.</p>
    <p>- <b>You may find that the lean UX implied by MVP may also result in better, crisper design.</b></p>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="bottomSwot">
    <div class="oppThreats swotRec">
      <p class="swotTitle">Make it work before you Make it pretty</p>
      <p>- This phrase should probably be tattooed on the arm of any web developer or designer.</p>
      <p>- While also true for design, in code it&#39;s especially true as <b>the penalty for making it “pretty” too soon can be devastating, many hours of wasted time that might completely be lost.</b><p>
    </div>
    <div class="oppThreats swotRec">
      <p class="swotTitle">Always do the process</p>
      <p>- This project was for a front-end web development class. I didn’t need to look at the strategic implications of this project, sketch designs, create digital wireframes, user test - any of that.  </p>
      <p>- But <b>for me, doing the design process is necessary for any kind of decision making.</b>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="bottomSwot">
    <div class="oppThreats  swotRec swotRecLong">
      <p class="swotTitle">Timing is tough</p>
      <p>- How long will that take? I can just see asking this questions as a designer/portfolio manager. And now I know the answer may not be that easy. I have learned a lot about what is hard and what is easy to do in code, but even seasoned developers are hit with unexpected issues that can drastically effect time to completion
      <p>Some that happened to me are:</p>
      <p>+ The “easy CSS” problem that took 3 hours to fix.<p>
      <p>+ The problem I didn’t know I had. Hey why is your website look like X, Y, Z on my Android…</p>
      <p>+ I am just going to finish one more thing… is it 4am?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="oppThreats swotRec swotRecLong">
      <p class="swotTitle">Scope creep</p>
      <p>- <b>Scope creep is one of the toughest things to manage in code.</b></p>
      <p>- I just need to do one more thing…</p>
      <p>- Wouldn't it be cool if…</p>
      <p>- STOP! Define the scope and stick to it. Don’t let a small project become the Taj Mahal.</p>
      <p>- What helps me is to <b>fall back on the concept of MVP.</b> What is the minimum I need to do to get this out? The rest goes on your Trello to do list. And it will be a long list.</p>
